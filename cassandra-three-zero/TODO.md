### Note

Cassandra Bridge implementation for Cassandra-all of version 3.0 is done and mostly working.

It needs some adjustments in order to work with open-source Cassandra-all library (21 compilation errors).

If there turns out to be public interest in having it available here, it will be open-sourced as a separate contribution.
